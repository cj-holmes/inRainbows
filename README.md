Radiohead album colour palettes.

I thought i'd like to have a go at producing some R colour palettes based on Radiohead album art. I got the idea from the briliant wesanderson library (https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson).

I'm using this project as both an opportuity to learn how to use GitHub whilst simultaneously learning about colour spaces and their implementation in R.
